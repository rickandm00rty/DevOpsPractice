The intention behind this repo is to serve as an example of my experimentation with all things DevOps. I find this field to be highly confusing but likely relevant to my career, so I would like to put together a series of examples illustrating I understand the principles behind different DevOp methods without needing to play around in large sandboxes. For obvious reasons, its quite difficult to get "real-world" experience in this field hence these micro-projects. Enjoy.
